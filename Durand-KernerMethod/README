To run my program first open up a shell window. Change the directory you are 
in to one that holds the file dk.c. You are now ready to run the program. 
gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall dk.c -o dk -lm is used to compile the program. To run 
the program with an imput type ./dk.c < (input).in and the program will run.
My program finds the roots of a polynomial using Durand-Kerner method by 
iteratively refining guesses with an update formula.
