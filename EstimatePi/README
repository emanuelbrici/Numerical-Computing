To run my program first open up a shell window. Change the directory you are
in to one that holds the file dk.c. You are now ready to run the program.
gcc -g -std=c99 EstimatingPi.c -o EstimatingPi is used to compile the program.
To run the program simply type ./EstimatingPi and the program will run and
give you an out put. You may need to adjust your terminal window size to get
everything display nicely. My program uses four different methods (Trapezoid
,Simpsons1/3, Simpsons3/8, Booles) to estimate Pi. The output in the window
terminal outputs the error or each method.
