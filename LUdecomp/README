To run my program first open up a shell window. Change the directory you are
in to one that holds the files downloaded. You are now ready to run the 
program. To compile the files given above type make in the terminal. 
After compile complition you can type make test in the terminal which
with run LUtest.c. Test.c will solve a 5x5, 10x10, and a 600x600 matrixs 
and tell you the error.
