Project: Computing Homography Transformations
Files:
	LUdecomp.h
	LUdecomp.c
	homography.c
	makefile
	README

To run my program first open up a shell window. Change the directory you are
in to one that holds the files downloaded. You are now ready to run the 
program. To compile the files given above type "make" in the terminal. My program
works when N is greater then 4 so you can run it on the shelves example. To run 
the boxtop this command will do it. 

$ ./homography < boxtop.in | ./hmap cheerios-small.ppm 500 650 > face.ppm

To run the shelves example type in 

$ ./homography < shelves.in | ./hmap shelves-left.ppm 1024 768 > shelves.ppm

This project you will create a module for solving linear equations of the form
Ax = b using LU decomposition and then use your module to build an application
that determines the parameters of an interesting image transformation involving 
projections.
