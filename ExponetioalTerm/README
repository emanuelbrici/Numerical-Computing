I found my minimal n for my Taylor series through my program relerror.c.
This program returned n with the corresponding upper bound for the relative 
error using the equation that was given in the assignment.Then I was able to 
find the smallest n so that the relative error was guaranteed to be below
1.19209x10^-7. I determined that n = 7 which informed me that I would need 
to use 7 terms from my Taylor series. It is possible that when the expirement
is run that the reletive error exceeds epsilon. This is most likely do to 
rounding error when calculations are being done in the myexp function.
